vk.com javascript
=================

I just scraped some javascript from vk.com. Study & enjoy.

How the result was accomplished:
0. Use wget to scrape pages within a certain sane limit.
0. Isolate js files.
0. Rename them in a more customary fashion, cutting away HTTP GET parameters.

See attached shell scripts for details.

Apparently, a topic dedicated to storing links to all known vk resources.
